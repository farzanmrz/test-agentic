Based on the information I have, here's what each of the capabilities for Gemini 2.5 Pro means:

* **Structured outputs:** This capability allows you to configure the model to generate responses in a specific, predefined format, such as JSON or enum values. This is useful for extracting information precisely and standardizing it for further processing, like building a database from resumes.
* **Caching:** Gemini 2.5 Pro supports both implicit and explicit caching.
    * **Implicit caching** is enabled by default and automatically passes cost savings back to you if your request hits a cache. This happens when your input content has a common prefix with previous requests.
    * **Explicit caching** allows you to manually cache input tokens and refer to them in subsequent requests. This can lead to guaranteed cost savings for repetitive tasks like chatbots with extensive instructions or recurring analysis of large documents.
* **Tuning:** The document indicates that "Tuning" is *Not supported* for Gemini 2.5 Pro directly on this page. However, based on search results, model tuning generally refers to the process of fine-tuning a model using your own data to adapt its behavior for specific tasks. For supported models like Gemini 2.5 Flash, it involves configuring parameters like epochs, adapter size, and learning rate.
* **Function calling:** This enables the model to connect with external tools and APIs. Instead of just generating text, the model can determine when to call specific functions and provide the necessary parameters to perform real-world actions, such as accessing external data, performing computations, or interacting with other systems.
* **Code execution:** This allows the model to generate and run Python code within an isolated environment, learning iteratively from the results to arrive at a final output. This is useful for tasks requiring code-based reasoning, like solving equations or processing text.
* **Search grounding:** This feature improves the accuracy and recency of model responses by connecting them to verifiable sources of information from Google Search. When enabled, it helps reduce model "hallucinations" (generating non-factual content) and provides in-line supporting links as sources.
* **Thinking:** Gemini 2.5 Pro utilizes an internal "thinking process" that significantly enhances its reasoning and multi-step planning abilities. This means the model can break down complex problems, think through each part, and iterate on solutions, leading to more accurate and robust responses, especially for tasks involving complex coding, math, and data analysis. Gemini 2.5 Pro has "thinking on by default," and it dynamically decides when and how much to think, with a configurable "thinking budget."

### Caching: Input/Output Examples and Explanation

Caching, in the context of Large Language Models (LLMs) like Gemini, is about storing parts of the input to avoid reprocessing them in subsequent requests. This saves on computational resources and can lead to significant cost savings. There are two main types of caching for Gemini 2.5 models: implicit and explicit.

**Normal Case (No Caching):**

Imagine you're building a chatbot that helps users with technical support for a complex software application. Every time a user asks a question, you provide the model with a large chunk of system instructions (e.g., "You are a friendly technical support agent for 'SoftwareX'. Your goal is to help users troubleshoot issues with 'SoftwareX' version 3.2. Always be polite and offer clear, step-by-step instructions. Do not provide information outside the scope of 'SoftwareX'.") along with the user's current query.

  * **Input:** "System instructions for SoftwareX support" + "User: My application is crashing when I open a file."
  * **Output:** Model processes the entire input and generates a response.
  * **Cost/Time:** You pay for processing the *entire* input every time.

**Implicit Caching:**

Implicit caching is like an automatic "memory" that the model manages itself. It's enabled by default for Gemini 2.5 models. If your current request has a common beginning (prefix) with a previous request, the model might "remember" that prefix and not re-process it, passing the cost savings back to you. The key is that you don't explicitly tell it to cache anything; it just happens if conditions are met.

  * **Example Scenario:** In the SoftwareX chatbot, most user interactions will start with the same "System instructions for SoftwareX support."
  * **First Request (no cache yet):**
      * **Input:** "System instructions for SoftwareX support" + "User: My application is crashing when I open a file."
      * **Output:** Model processes the entire input.
      * **Cost/Time:** Standard cost/time for the full input.
  * **Subsequent Request (implicit cache hit):**
      * **Input:** "System instructions for SoftwareX support" + "User: How do I update my software?"
      * **How it works:** The model recognizes that "System instructions for SoftwareX support" is a prefix it has seen recently. It implicitly reuses the processing for this part, only processing the new "User: How do I update my software?" part.
      * **Output:** Model generates a response based on the combined understanding.
      * **Cost/Time:** Reduced cost, as only the new part of the input is fully processed. You don't do anything extra; the system handles it. To increase the chance of implicit cache hits, it's recommended to put large and common content at the beginning of your prompts and send requests with similar prefixes in a short amount of time.

**Explicit Caching:**

Explicit caching gives you direct control over what content is cached and for how long. You manually create a "cache" of input tokens and then refer to that cache in future requests. This is useful when you have large, static pieces of information that you'll be using repeatedly, and you want to guarantee cost savings.

  * **Example Scenario:** You have a 50-page user manual for "SoftwareX" that you want the chatbot to refer to. Sending this manual with every prompt would be very expensive.
  * **Step 1: Create an Explicit Cache:**
      * You send the entire 50-page "SoftwareX User Manual" to the API with a request to cache it. You also set a "time to live" (TTL) for how long the cache should exist (e.g., 24 hours).
      * **Input:** API call to create a cache with the "SoftwareX User Manual" content.
      * **Output:** The API returns a cache ID (e.g., `cache_id_softwarex_manual`).
  * **Step 2: Use the Explicit Cache in Chatbot Interactions:**
      * **Input:** Reference to `cache_id_softwarex_manual` + "User: How do I reset my password?"
      * **How it works:** The model accesses the pre-processed tokens for the manual via the `cache_id_softwarex_manual`, combining them with the user's query.
      * **Output:** Model generates a response grounded in the manual's content.
      * **Cost/Time:** Significantly reduced cost for each interaction, as you're only paying for the processing of the user's short query, not the entire manual each time. You pay a reduced rate for the cached tokens.

**What the "Caching: Supported" in the page means:**

When the web page says "Caching: Supported" for Gemini 2.5 Pro, it means that this model variant has the underlying infrastructure and functionality to perform both implicit and explicit caching as described above. It's a built-in feature you can leverage for efficiency and cost optimization.

### Live API

The "Live API" capability on the web page, especially for models like [Gemini 2.0 Flash Live](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models%23gemini-2.0-flash-live), is designed for **low-latency, real-time, bidirectional voice and video interactions**. Think of it as enabling highly natural, human-like conversations with the model.

Here's what it means:

  * **Real-time Interaction:** Unlike typical request-response patterns where you send a full prompt and wait for a full response, the Live API allows for continuous streaming of audio, video, or text. This means the model can process your input as you're speaking or showing it something, and it can start responding immediately.
  * **Bidirectional:** It's a two-way street. You can speak to the model, and it speaks back to you. Crucially, it supports **interruption**, meaning you can cut off the model's response if you've heard enough or want to rephrase, just like in a natural conversation.
  * **Multimodality (Audio/Video Focus):** While it can handle text, a primary strength of the Live API is its ability to understand and generate audio. With certain models like [Gemini 2.5 Flash Native Audio](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models#gemini-2.5-flash-native-audio), it can produce very natural and realistic-sounding speech, and even understand nuances in tone (affective dialog) or proactively decide when to respond to ambient sounds. It's designed to eventually handle real-time video streams as well.
  * **Use Cases:** Ideal for applications like:
      * Highly interactive chatbots or virtual assistants where a smooth, natural spoken conversation is crucial.
      * Customer service interactions.
      * Educational tools that provide immediate verbal feedback.
      * Any scenario where you need a fast, fluid, and human-like voice interface with an AI.

### Search Grounding

You're spot on with your understanding of search grounding and its relationship to Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)\!

**What is Search Grounding?**

"Grounding" in LLMs means ensuring the model's responses are based on verifiable, up-to-date, and specific information, rather than just its general training data (which can be static and might contain inaccuracies or "hallucinations"). Search grounding, specifically, uses a search mechanism to retrieve relevant information from external sources to "ground" the model's response.

  * **Normal LLM (without grounding):** When you ask an LLM a question, it generates a response based on the vast amount of data it was trained on. This is like it's trying to answer from memory. Sometimes this "memory" can be outdated or even incorrect, leading to plausible-sounding but factually wrong answers (hallucinations).
  * **LLM with Search Grounding:** When you enable search grounding, before the LLM generates a response, it first performs a search (e.g., using Google Search) to find relevant, up-to-date information. It then uses this retrieved information *in addition to* its internal knowledge to formulate a more accurate, factual, and verifiable answer. It also provides the sources (links) for the information it used.

**Is Google Search the only option? Does it only work with Gemini models?**

  * **For Gemini models and Google's grounding feature:** Yes, when you see "Search grounding: Supported" for Gemini models, it specifically means that this capability integrates with **Google Search** as the knowledge source. This is a built-in feature provided by Google.
  * **Third-party models (like Anthropic):** You are correct. Anthropic (or OpenAI, etc.) are separate companies. Their models do not inherently have "Google Search grounding" built-in as a native feature because Google Search is a Google product.
  * **Your RAG intuition is correct\!** This is where your understanding of RAG comes in. Search grounding is a specific implementation of a broader concept called **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**.
      * **RAG** is a framework or technique where an LLM is *augmented* with a *retrieval* component. This retrieval component can pull information from *any* external knowledge base.
      * So, while Google's "Search grounding" uses Google Search, you, as a developer, could implement your own RAG system with any LLM (including Anthropic's models or even Gemini models with your own custom RAG setup) that pulls from:
          * Your company's internal documents (e.g., product manuals, FAQs, financial reports).
          * Databases.
          * Specific websites or collections of documents you've curated.
          * Any other authoritative data source you choose.
      * In a RAG setup, you typically:
        1.  Store your knowledge base (documents, data) in a way that's easily searchable (often using vector databases).
        2.  When a user asks a question, your system first queries your knowledge base to find relevant chunks of information.
        3.  These retrieved chunks are then provided to the LLM along with the user's original query.
        4.  The LLM uses this "grounding" information to generate a more accurate and contextually relevant response.

So, while "Search grounding" on the Gemini models page refers to Google Search, the underlying principle is RAG, which is a versatile technique you can apply with various LLMs and data sources.
