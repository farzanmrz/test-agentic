# Overview
**Finance:** The finance department oversees the company's financial health, managing budgeting, forecasting, financial reporting, and accounting. It ensures the company makes sound financial decisions and complies with all relevant fiscal regulations.

# Documents

## Financial Statements and Reports
Monthly/quarterly financial reports, P&L statements, balance sheets, cash flow reports, as well as variance analysis documents. Often stored in PDFs or Excel, these contain the figures that executives might query in a meeting ("what was our Q2 gross margin?").
* "*What were our total revenues and net profit in Q1 2025?*" – (Fetches from the Q1 financial report or system and provides the figures, possibly with year-over-year comparison if asked.)
* "*Show me the trend of operating expenses in the last 3 quarters and identify any major variances.*" – (Pulls data from quarterly reports and maybe even generates a brief summary, e.g., "Opex increased 5% in Q3 due to higher marketing spend.")

## Budget Plans and Forecasts
Annual budgets, department-wise spending plans, and rolling forecasts (often in spreadsheets or planning software). These documents outline expected vs. actual spending and can be queried for insights (e.g. "current spend vs budget for marketing").
* "*Summarize last month's budget vs actual for the IT department – where did we overspend?*" – (Looks at the department's budget report, highlights any categories where actual exceeded budget and by how much.)

## Expense Policies and Approvals
Documents outlining what expenditures are allowed (travel, entertainment, procurement thresholds) and the workflows for approval. While more policy than number-heavy, enabling chat Q&A here prevents costly policy violations.
* "*According to our travel policy, is a \$200 per night hotel within allowed expense?*" – (Retrieves the relevant section of the expense policy document to confirm if it's within the limit.)

## Audit and Compliance Reports
Internal audit findings, tax compliance documents, SOX compliance checklists, etc., that finance teams need to reference to ensure controls are followed.
* "*Do we have any outstanding compliance tasks from the last audit report?*" – (Finds the internal audit report and lists open action items or recommendations.)

# Value Proposition
The value of RAG in finance is in **speeding up analysis and ensuring accuracy/consistency** in answers:

* **Instant Access to Financial Data (Democratization):** Executives and non-finance managers often need numbers on the fly. A chat assistant lets them retrieve figures without waiting on analysts – e.g., a sales manager can ask about their region's profitability this quarter and get an answer in seconds. This **self-service analytics** reduces bottlenecks. RAG can present historical spend, revenue trends, or performance by department in a *clear, usable format*, instead of someone manually compiling data.
* **Improved Decision-Making:** Because the assistant can cross-reference multiple documents (budgets, forecasts, actuals), it can help spot risks or anomalies early. For instance, if asked, "*Are there any budget categories trending over forecast?*" it could surface that travel spend is 20% over plan and cite the data. This helps finance teams and business units course-correct faster, supporting the business plan with greater confidence. The team spends less time hunting for numbers and more time on strategy and analysis.
* **Consistency and Accuracy in Policy Enforcement:** By consulting the official expense or finance policy documents via chat, everyone gets the same interpretation. This reduces emails to finance asking "is this allowed?" and ensures decisions (like approving a vendor payment) are compliant with internal controls and external regulations. It also helps during audits – e.g., an auditor or compliance officer can quickly query past records or policy specifics.
* **Efficiency in Routine Reporting:** Some organizations are using RAG to auto-generate or summarize reports. For example, **automated report generation** can pull data via APIs and use an LLM to narrate the highlights. One company case showed that summarizing regular analytical reports with LLMs saved hours per report. A finance chatbot could similarly create a quick narrative ("cash flow is up this month due to improved receivables collection") as a starting point for finance reviews.

# Current Market
The intersection of AI and finance analytics is growing. Business intelligence tools are adding natural language query features – for instance, some modern BI platforms let users ask questions of dashboards in plain English. There are also startups focusing on **AI assistants for CFOs** that plug into ERP systems and financial databases. For example, analysts at Grab (a tech company) built a RAG-based system to automatically generate and summarize routine reports, reducing manual effort by 3-4 hours each time. In the enterprise software arena, Microsoft's Power BI and Oracle's analytics are exploring GPT-powered chat to fetch metrics. While still early, even some big accounting firms have begun deploying internal RAG assistants – e.g., PwC has been working on AI assistants for tax and compliance research. These references illustrate a push toward leveraging RAG so finance professionals can query data and policies dynamically, instead of trawling through spreadsheets.

# Market Gap
A major opportunity is making the **chat assistant not just a Q&A tool, but an analytical advisor.** Today's RAG setups retrieve facts from documents; tomorrow's could perform calculations or scenario analysis on the fly. For example, one underserved use case is "What-If" analysis via chat: *"If we increase Product A's price by 5%, what happens to gross margin based on last year's data?"* – an advanced system could retrieve the formula and data to compute an answer or at least outline the factors. This requires integrating the RAG approach with analytical engines or internal calculators. Another area is **combining internal and external data**: finance decisions often consider market data (exchange rates, economic indicators). An innovative assistant might fetch internal data and allow plug-ins to external financial info to answer, say, currency exposure questions. Additionally, ensuring **data governance** in responses – e.g., the assistant understanding user permissions (so a manager can't see another department's payroll) – is an ongoing challenge and opportunity for improvement in enterprise settings. Finally, as LLMs improve at handling tables and math, we could see the assistant directly generating new forecasts or variance explanations in a conversational manner. In summary, while current RAG solutions in finance excel at retrieval and basic summaries, the next wave could transform them into proactive financial planning aides.
