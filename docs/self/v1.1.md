# 1. Project Vision & Mission
**Version:** 1.1
**Last Updated:** June 18, 2025

We are building a **visual agentic workflow web application** designed to automate enterprise tasks for the Indian B2B market.

Our mission is to empower non-technical enterprise users by providing intuitive, low-cost AI tools that integrate seamlessly with their existing workflows. The initial focus is on enabling users to "chat with their documents" (e.g., Excel reports, HR policies, SOPs) through a simple, RAG-based interface, delivering an immediate and magical experience of information accessibility.

The long-term vision is to expand from simple document interaction to a full-fledged visual workflow builder where users can create, automate, and manage complex cross-departmental processes without writing any code.

# 2. Business Opportunity & GTM Strategy

## 2.1. The Market Opportunity
The Indian market is at an inflection point for AI adoption. Large enterprise solutions are too slow and expensive, while smaller startups lack the capital and enterprise access to scale. We are positioned to fill this gap.

## 2.2. Competitive Advantage
Our key advantage is the ability to test, validate, and iterate our product in a **real-world production environment** through a family-owned large-scale manufacturing company. This provides an invaluable, high-speed feedback loop that is exceptionally difficult for competitors to replicate.

## 2.3. Core Strategy
* **Augment, Don't Replace:** Our core insight, learned from a previous ERP venture, is that Indian enterprise users are deeply attached to their Excel-based workflows. Instead of fighting this behavior, we will build *on top of it*. Our agents will work the way users already work, enhancing their capabilities with speed and intelligence.
* **Deliver Clear ROI:** We will focus on creating high-leverage, low-cost agentic tools that solve tangible operational pain points. The value proposition is simple: if a $400/month manual task can be replaced by a $100/month automated agent, it's a clear win for management in a cost-sensitive market.
* **Department-Specific Use Cases:** We will leverage firsthand experience from previous ventures to research and target high-friction workflows in Sales, HR, Operations, Procurement, and Finance where automation can deliver significant, often unnoticed, gains.

# 3. Product Roadmap

The product will be developed iteratively in the following phases:

## Phase 1: Local Proof of Concept (Current Focus)
* **Functionality:** A RAG-based AI agent that allows a user to interact with their enterprise documents (Excel reports, procurement forms, HR policies, etc.) via a simple chat interface.
* **Goal:** Deliver the initial "magic moment" where internal information becomes instantly accessible through natural language.

## Phase 2: Cloud Deployment & Foundation
* **Objective:** Move the application from a local environment to a scalable cloud infrastructure to enable faster iteration and validation.
* **Platform:** Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is the target.
* **Key Decision:** Actively researching the optimal deployment architecture: Compute Engine VMs, Docker containers, GKE (Kubernetes), serverless Cloud Functions, or a hybrid model.

## Phase 3: Visual Workflow Builder
* **Functionality:** Evolve the simple chat UI into a visual, drag-and-drop interface using **React Flow**.
* **User Experience:** Users can build simple workflows by connecting nodes (e.g., "Parse Excel," "Filter Rows," "Send Email"). The backend will receive this visual graph as JSON and execute the corresponding agentic tasks.

## Phase 4: Advanced Agent Capabilities & Integration
* **Features:** Develop agents that can not only interpret and analyze data but also **generate and modify Excel sheets**, automate complex report creation, and integrate with a wider host of enterprise applications.
* **Goal:** To become an indispensable tool that automates entire operational workflows, making the very users who once resisted change more efficient and valuable.

# 4. Technical Stack & Development Environment

* **Backend:** FastAPI with Uvicorn
* **Frontend:** React (initially a simple chat interface, evolving to use **React Flow** for visual workflows)
* **Agentic AI Framework:** CrewAI
* **Python Version:** 3.11
* **Environment Management:** Conda
* **Code Editor:** Visual Studio Code
* **Machine:** MacBook Pro M1 Max (Sequoia / macOS Sonoma)
* **Deployment:**
    * **Current:** Local machine only.
    * **Next Step:** Google Cloud Platform (GCP) - specific services under evaluation.

# 5. Project Context

* **Project Lead:** Farzan
* **Company Entity:** The project is being developed under the existing (though dormant) entity, **Optium**.
* **Background Context:** The strategy is informed by lessons learned from developing a full-scale ERP system with Optium, providing deep insights into enterprise user behavior and workflow friction points.
